Analysis:

## This analysis provides insight to the school district to help them maake future budgeting decisions.

- The higher the budget per student, the lower the average scores and passing rates for both math and reading 

- Reading scores are higher than math scores for both average and passing scores 

 - The lowest 5 performing schools were larger schools

 - The larger the school, the larger the budget

 - The more money a district gets, does not mean it will yield better passing results

- Smaller schools are performing better than larger schools despite receiving less money

- Money is not a determining factor for better results, but the size of school is
